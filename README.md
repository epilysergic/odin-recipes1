odin project HTML ending lesson
I will be combining what I learned in the odin project to create a rudementary website.

I have learned basic skills in HTML, such as anchors, HTML elements and images
I have also learned the basic of git and github. I realize that it is used to track code modifications in an organized manner.
I am also getting more familliar with using the command line 
I have also become familiarr with using linux by downloading xubunthu Virtual machine

Excited to get this working
